# rails-clone

Rails-like Ruby web framework build from scratch

### Motivation

> What I cannot create, I do not understand - Richard Feynman

### Approach

This fun project is based on the principle of re-creating things so that I can
fully understand them. I start from scratch in small steps using TDD. Each 
commit is a usable MVP (minimum viable product) that is small enough to fit in 
my head. Feel free to browse the commit history to see what I am doing and 
understand how Rails works internally. Commits contain specs that further 
describe things. I guess it would be much easier for anyone to understand the 
Rails magic in small clean steps rather than browsing through the huge 
[Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails) repo.
