# rails-clone

Rails-like Ruby web framework rebuild from scratch

### Motivation

> What I cannot create, I do not understand - Richard Feynman

### Approach

This "fun" project is based on the principle of re-creating things so that I
can fully understand them. I start from scratch in small steps using TDD. Each 
commit is a usable MVP (minimum viable product) that is small enough to fit in 
my head. The implementation is oversimplified in order to understand the
principles behind Rails magic in general, rather than focusing on details and
corner cases. Feel free to browse the commit history to see what I am doing and 
understand how Rails works internally. Commits contain specs that further 
describe things. I consider it much easier to understand the Rails magic in 
small clean simple steps rather than browsing and reading through the huge
[Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails) repo.
